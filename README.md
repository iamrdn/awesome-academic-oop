This is a curated list of **academic** (!) books and papers on
object-oriented programming, which promote "object thinking."
We are looking for papers that go along or disagree with the following
hypothesises from [Elegant Objects](http://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)
book series (in order of importance):

  * Objects are not data containers
  * Getters and setters are evil
  * Static methods are evil
  * Objects must be immutable
  * Implementation inheritance is evil
  * NULL is evil
  * Constructors must be code free
  * Type casting (and reflection) is evil
  * Java annotations are evil
  * Interfaces must be small

William R. Cook.
**Object-oriented programming versus abstract data types**.
_Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages: REX School/Workshop Noordwijkerhout_,
1990,
[Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0019443).

> This tutorial collects and elaborates arguments for distinguishing between object-oriented programming and abstract data types.
